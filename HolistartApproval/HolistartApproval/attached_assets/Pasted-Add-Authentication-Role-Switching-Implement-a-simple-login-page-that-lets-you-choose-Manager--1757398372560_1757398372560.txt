Add Authentication & Role Switching

Implement a simple login page that lets you choose “Manager,” “LOB Head,” or “Director.”

Store the selected role in local storage or app state.

On each page, read the role and conditionally show or hide functionality:
– Managers only see “Create MRF” (future) and their own dashboard.
– LOB Heads see MRF approvals (≤₹35K) and onboarding.
– Directors see only escalated requests; LOB Heads should no longer see Escalate button—auto-escalation occurs in the backend logic.

Remove Manual “Escalate to Director” Button

In app.js, change the salary check: if salaryMax >35,000, immediately mark request status = “escalated” and decrease LOB queue.

Do not render an “Escalate” button. Instead, after you tap “Approve” on a high-salary MRF, show a note/toast: “Request auto-escalated to Director.”

Ensure the Director’s queue count increments automatically.

Enable Director Login & View

Once escalated, load the Director dashboard page on login:
– List only escalated MRF requests under that user’s Director role.

Allow the Director to tap a request, view details, and approve/reject.

After Director approval, remove it from Director queue and send a confirmation toast.

Wire Up Reports & Settings

Add two new pages: /reports and /settings.
– Reports: display simple charts or summary data from sample dataset.
– Settings: let user adjust salary threshold (default ₹35,000) and theme.

Update bottom navigation so tapping “Reports” or “Settings” navigates to these pages.

Ensure navigation, header title, and action bar update accordingly.

Add “Full Details” Pages

Create two additional detail pages:
– Full MRF Detail: shows every field from the BRD, including cost center, business line, etc.
– Full Onboarding Detail: includes all candidate asset requirements and onboarding tasks.

Link these from the existing list pages with a “View Full Details” button.

Test & Validate

Start as “Manager,” create a dummy MRF in code, and submit.

Login as “LOB Head” to approve low-salary; verify it goes to Onboarding.

Approve a high-salary MRF and confirm it vanishes from LOB and appears in Director dashboard automatically.

Login as “Director” to approve/reject escalated requests.

Navigate to Reports and Settings to confirm links and UI work.

Test “Full Details” pages from lists.
